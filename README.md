*Writing docs should be simple ðŸ“– ðŸ“–*

## Motivation
Today developers either front or back or even full-stack are overwhelmed, every day there are more and more packages, lib, frameworks etc... It's sometimes complicated to be up to date and a good documentation play a major role in the acquisition of a project.

This is why i decided to create this project, outhere there are some projects like Docusaurus, VuePress, GitBook.. They all do the job very well but i think the basic idea of â€‹â€‹creating the documentation has been lost from sight for the benefit of:

* Not SEO-friendly.
* Focused on a commercial product.
* Too many features.
* Configuration is not easy.
* ...

Just-docs tends to solve all the problems mentioned above, the main goal is to stay focused on writing documentation for your product and your users. By giving a simple API to use and just what you need to customize your documentation you can stay focus on writing.

The themes of the generated sites were thought by designers so that the reading is more pleasant.

> **Note** - The project is actually in development we're working hard to release it quickly.

## Features
* Simple API to use.
* SSR with React.
* A simple config file no more big config file.
* Beautiful theme, specially build for reading.
